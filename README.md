### :one: Content :scroll:

- **Exercice 1 :** Let's start with a little warm-up exercise we already carried out, a few weeks ago, around a list of famous entrepreneurs that we are going to handle, retreat, manipulate... ðŸ˜‡

- **Exercice 2 :** The 2nd round of exercises is based on the ol' classic book collection or so-called "library model", which makes it possible to work on sorting the books, determinating the most or the least borrowed, etc.

- **Exercice 3 :** Finally, here comes a good batch of data manipulations based on a large data file formatted as a table of hashes. Just what's needed to use the "map", "filter", "find", "findIndex", "sort", "reverse" and many other methods!

### :two: How to :bulb:

1. Create an empty directory on your :computer:
2. Clone the current :octocat: repository to the latter
3. Launch the "index.html" file (no local web server should be needed)
4. Have (giga) fun :satisfied: with the proposed genuine approach to solve the different exercises

_NB: be sure to check your brower's console to see :eyes: some of the (somehow hidden) results of the above :wink:_
